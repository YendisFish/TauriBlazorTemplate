# How to install
Dotnet for some reason doesnt want to package this in a Nuget package,
so I have some instructions on how to install this. And they are quite
simple.

First clone the repository:
```shell
git clone https://github.com/YendisFish/TauriBlazorTemplate
cd TauriBlazorTemplate
```

Then install the template with dotnet
```shell
dotnet new install ./
```

You can then safely remove the source code. Or keep it, whatever you like! :)
